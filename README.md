# jdupes-sidecar.py

**jdupes-sidecar.py** is a Python script that automates file deduplication using [jdupes](https://jdupes.com) (on Linux systems). It extends `jdupes` functionality by:

- Preserving the order of directories when deciding which duplicates to keep.
- Creating sidecar files that record the paths of deleted duplicates.
- Offering dry run mode to preview actions without making changes.
- Allowing custom paths for `jdupes` binary and hash database.

## Features

- **Directory Order Preservation**: Uses `--param-order` with `jdupes` to consider the order of directories provided when deciding which duplicate file to keep.
- **Sidecar Files**: Creates a `.dupes` sidecar file alongside the surviving file, listing the full paths of the deleted duplicates.
- **Dry Run Mode**: Allows you to preview actions without deleting files or creating sidecar files.
- **Verbosity Levels**: Adjustable verbosity to control the amount of output.
- **Progress Display**: Shows real-time progress from `jdupes` and progress bars for processing duplicates.
- **Customizable `jdupes` Options**: Specify custom paths for `jdupes` binary and hash database.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3**: The script requires Python 3.6 or newer.
- **jdupes**: Ensure you have `jdupes` installed on your system. Tested with jdupes-1.27.3.
- **tqdm Module**: Used for displaying progress bars. Install via `apt` or `pip`.

## Installation

### 1. Install `jdupes`

Follow the instructions on the [jdupes Codeberg repository](https://codeberg.org/jbruchon/jdupes).

### 2. Install `tqdm` Module

Install `tqdm` using `apt` (recommended):

```bash
sudo apt install python3-tqdm
```

Alternatively, install using `pip`:

```bash
pip3 install tqdm
```

### 3. Download the Script

Clone this repository or download `jdupes-sidecar.py` directly:

```bash
wget https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository/jdupes-sidecar.py
```

### 4. Make the Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x jdupes-sidecar.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
./jdupes-sidecar.py [options] /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2 ...
```

Provide the directories you want to deduplicate as arguments. The order of directories determines which duplicates are kept (first directory has the highest priority).

### Options

- `-n`, `--dry-run`: Perform a dry run without deleting files or creating sidecar files.
- `-o OUTPUT`, `--output OUTPUT`: Output file for dry run report (default: `dry_run_output.txt`).
- `-v`, `--verbose`: Increase output verbosity. Can be used multiple times (`-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`).
- `--progress`: Display progress information.
- `--jdupes-path JDUPES_PATH`: Path to the `jdupes` binary (default: `jdupes`).
- `--jdupes-hashdb JDUPES_HASHDB`: Path to the hash database file to be used by `jdupes`.
- `-h`, `--help`: Show help message and exit.

### Examples

#### 1. Dry Run Mode with Default Verbosity

```bash
./jdupes-sidecar.py -n /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2
```

- Performs a dry run.
- Outputs actions to `dry_run_output.txt`.
- No files are deleted or modified.

#### 2. Normal Mode with Confirmation and Verbosity

```bash
./jdupes-sidecar.py -v /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2
```

- Runs in normal mode.
- Asks for confirmation before proceeding.
- Outputs informational messages due to `-v`.

#### 3. Normal Mode with Progress Display

```bash
./jdupes-sidecar.py --progress /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2
```

- Displays real-time progress from `jdupes`.
- Shows a progress bar for processing duplicates.

#### 4. Specify Custom `jdupes` Path and Hash Database

```bash
./jdupes-sidecar.py --jdupes-path /usr/local/bin/jdupes --jdupes-hashdb /var/hashdb.txt /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2
```

- Uses a custom `jdupes` binary.
- Specifies a hash database for `jdupes`.

#### 5. Full Command with All Options

```bash
./jdupes-sidecar.py --jdupes-path /usr/local/bin/jdupes --jdupes-hashdb /var/hashdb.txt --progress -vv -o report.txt /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2
```

- Uses custom `jdupes` path and hash database.
- Displays progress and sets verbosity to DEBUG level.
- Outputs dry run report to `report.txt`.

## Notes and Considerations

- **Directory Order Matters**: The order of directories provided determines which duplicates are kept. The first directory has the highest priority.
- **Dry Run Mode**: Always recommended to perform a dry run first to verify actions.
- **Verbosity Levels**:
  - No `-v`: Warnings and errors are displayed.
  - `-v`: Informational messages are included.
  - `-vv` or higher: Detailed debug information is shown.
- **Progress Display**: Requires `tqdm` module. Shows real-time progress from `jdupes` and script processing.
- **Permissions**:
  - Ensure you have read/write/delete permissions for the specified directories.
  - When running with `sudo`, make sure `tqdm` is installed for the root user.
- **Hash Database**:
  - Use `--jdupes-hashdb` to specify a hash database file for `jdupes`.
  - Improves performance for large datasets.
  - Ensure you have permissions to read/write the hash database file.
- **Safety Measures**:
  - The script prompts for confirmation in normal mode.
  - Includes error handling for file operations and `jdupes` execution.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Requires `jdupes` to be installed and accessible.
  - Requires `tqdm` module for progress display.
